# This backend service only allows connection to AWS RDS service
# You will need to set up an AWS RDS PostgreSQL yourself if you want to run this locally

# If you insist on running a local PostgreSQL, simply go into database.go and replace the
# connectionStr variable with your own connection string

# If using AWS RDS service instead, please remove comment symbol on config.go file line 14 - 18
# so that the content of your .env file can be read
# The reason why the lines are commented out is because deployment platform Render does not need
# these lines, and including them will causing deployment failure due to error in loading env variables

# PostgreSQL username
DB_USER=

# PostgreSQL database password
DB_PASSWORD=

# Your amazon web service RDS endpoint string

# Frontend base url to set up CORS policy config
